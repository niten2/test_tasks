- The site is built on the API. For example, write a website-parser of some AirBnB or again Avito, which, upon the necessary requests, will find and form a more detailed selection of goods, track their average price and give an offer more advantageous than that which exists now. Those. will analyze the data better than the original.

- Analogue of Yelp. This is an example of a typical live project, a site with ratings and reviews, the ability to write them, places on the map, photos, ratings, categories, search, even API. A full set very well will teach you how to write projects with rating systems and work with users and their feedback. And this can often be found on freelancing, such as the next pick-up of restaurants, pharmacies, fitness centers.

- A typical platform store (Avito). Well, everything is obvious, the stores did not write - life was wasted.

- Scrapers, parsers, and other tools. Very often you need it in projects, plus you learn a lot about working with other sites or their API.
