### Create a simple one-page web application (React + Redux, LESS) about the price of shares/currencies (your choice).

The data can be taken from the Yahoo website:
https://goo.gl/pDT2GY
https://goo.gl/dmqXRm
or other sources.

The application should be able to:

1. Add, delete company / currency.
2. Save locally data (restore when you re-enter), update data on demand, or automatically.
3. The development result should be stored on the GitHub service with the local commits of the developer.
